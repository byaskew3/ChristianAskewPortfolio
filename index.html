                <p> I currently reside in New Mexico, but was originally born and raised in Lawton, OK. I served in the military from 2014-2018. Once I was done, I decided to go to school for Computer Science. Even then, I never really got into coding much. I fell into the trap of "Imposter Syndrome" and thought I was the only one having a hard time. For the past couple of months, I decided to give it another go and realized I was picking it up easier then before. I now enjoy every part of it, I look at it as an art. One of my biggest hobbies is video games, especially competitive ones! As of recently, I've explored a new hobby with my girlfriend and that's Escape Rooms! We both fell in love with the problem-solving aspect and the challenge. I want to be a developer because although its tough, it's rewarding and promising.
